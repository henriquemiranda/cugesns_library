|      For optimal performance we recommend that you set                      |
|        NPAR = 4 - approx SQRT( number of cores)                             |
|      (number of cores/NPAR must be integer)                                 |
|      This setting will greatly improve the performance of VASP for DFT.     |
|      The default NPAR=number of cores might be grossly inefficient          |
|      on modern multi-core architectures or massively parallel machines.     |
|      Do your own testing.                                                   |
|      Unfortunately you need to use the default for hybrid, GW and RPA       |
|      calculations.                                                          |
|                                                                             |

|      You have enabled k-point parallelism (KPAR>1).                         |
|      This developmental code was originally  written by Paul Kent at ORNL,  |
|      and carefully double checked in Vienna.                                |
|      GW as well as linear response parallelism added by Martijn Marsman     |
|      and Georg Kresse.                                                      |
|      Carefully verify results versus KPAR=1.                                |
|      Report problems to Paul Kent and Vienna.                               |
